## Background
Originally stemmed from an advanced mechatronics line following project, this is a device capable of following a path and delivering a payload.  Warehouse automation, as done famously by Amazon, is loosely inspired from this project.

## Microncontroller Development
A PIC32MX250F128D is mapped onto a standard 0.1 solderless breadboard.  Included documentation is referenced for appropriate circuitry.  Additionally, two buttons are interfaced to the PIC: one as a switch creating high logic into the PWR pin of the PIC, causing a reset, and another as a standard digital input with a 10k pullup resistor.  Three LEDs are also included in the assembly: one denoting power, another for PWM fade display, and another as a standard digital out.  For the moment, a microUSB provides a clean 5V power supply to a 3.3V regulator and offers no serial communication.

Breakouts for the PICKit3 are also included, enabling simple reprogramming via the Microchip IDE and optional Harmony.

## Peripheral Interfacing
A small 140px by 60px LED display is connected to the PIC via one of its available I2C connections.  A library is written to handle text management and included in the install.  A 6-axis IMU from Pololu is interfaced to the PIC via <b>INSERT COMMUNICATION MODE HERE</b> connection.  Upon specifying the correct pragma values and calibration, a live readout of the accelerometer's values is published at approximately 8hz and visually expressed as numerical and graphical values through the LED display.

## PCB Design
Upon verifying the solderless assembly to be correctly wired and programmable, a 2" x 2" PCB was designed via Eagle as a more permanent basis for future projects.  A solderless mount was incorporated into the design to accept a thru-hole PIC32MX250F128D, in the interest of forgivability.  Breakouts for all usable pins are mapped between one of two layers.  As a new opportunity to develop smaller components, surface mount resistors, LEDs, and voltage regulators were utilized.  The PCB is manufactured in quantities of 10 via a rapid prototyping service.  Two wiring breakouts were needed in order to warrant the PCB functional.

## Vehicle Design
Given two small DC 100:1 gearmotors and an optional servo, a pseudo-holonomic vehicle was developed using one degree of freedom as the angle of turn, as dictated by the servo motor.  As enabled by the servo motor, the driving wheel is capable of a full 180 degree turning angle. An additional degree of freedom for forward/backward motion through the DC motor directly coupled to the swiveling wheel.  Two passive wheels rotate freely on 3D-printed mounted shafts and enable the vehicle to completely turn on a zero-radius center.

The remaining DC motor drives a rather crude, but simple, leadscrew linear transmission mechanism that drives one of the two available degrees of freedom in the 4-parallel 5-bar linkage that controls the lifting platform.  The remaining degree of freedom in the linkage is unconstrained, but offers the advantage of self-centering the load above the vehicle when a payload has been received.  As an advantage to having the 5-bar linkages in parallel, the load is supported via four points along its outermost perimeter.

The frame itself is constructed from lasercut birch wood.  Using 3mm screws to fasten nearly all of the joints and cheap zinc-plated washers as low friction thrust bearings, nylok nuts are used to ensure that axial compression remains constant and controlled.  Overall, the joints are toleranced for slip fits and orient relatively well for the context of available build materials and budget.

A 3D printed mount is also included into the build for accepting a $40 Android phone.  The phone's rear-facing camera is intended to be used as a line following computer vision app, described more in the following section.

## Android Vision

## Results
The linear actuator that drives the 5-bar lifting mechanism was binding despite precautions to maximize guide shaft engagement, tolerance the fit, and minimize friction.  A brushed aluminum shaft against the lasercut interface of birch wood suggests a poor option for handling high loads with minimal effort.  An approximate 1.5 diameters engagement along the guide shaft was incorporated into the design, and it's thought that 3.0 diameters may offer better results.
